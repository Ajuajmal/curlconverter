Title: Tools to Transform 'cURL' Command-line Calls to 'httr' Requests

Description: Deciphering web/'REST' 'API' and 'XHR' calls can be tricky, which is one reason
    why internet browsers provide "Copy as cURL" functionality within their "Developer Tools"
    pane(s). These 'cURL' command-lines can be difficult to wrangle into an 'httr' 'GET' or
    'POST' request, but you can now "straighten" these 'cURLs' either from data copies to the
    system clipboard or by passing in a vector of 'cURL' command-lines and getting back a
    list of parameter elements which can be used to form 'httr' requests. Enhancements are
    planned to auto-generate 'httr' 'GET' and 'POST' requests or function bodies from the
    parsed 'cURL' command-lines.
